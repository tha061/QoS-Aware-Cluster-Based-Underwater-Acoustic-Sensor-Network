# QoS-Aware-Cluster-Based-Underwater-Acoustic-Sensor-Network

This is the MATLAB implementation of the QoS-aware Cluster-based Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network.

### Brief Description:
A practical low-complexity MAC (medium access control) scheme for quality of service (QoS)-aware and cluster-based underwater acoustic sensor
networks (UASN), in which the provision of differentiated QoS is required. In such a network, underwater sensors (U-sensor) in a cluster are divided into several classes, each
of which has a different QoS requirement. The major problem considered is the maximization of the number of nodes that a cluster can accommodate while still
providing the required QoS for each class in terms of the PDR (packet delivery ratio). In order to address the problem, we ﬁrst estimate the packet delivery probability (PDP) and use it to formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal value of the maximum packet retransmissions for each QoS class. The custom greedy and interior-point algorithms are used to ﬁnd the optimal solutions, which are veriﬁed by extensive simulations. The simulation results show that, by solving the proposed optimization problem, the supportable number of underwater sensor nodes can be maximized while satisfying the QoS requirements for each class.
